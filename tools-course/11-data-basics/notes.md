# Data Basics Notes

- JSON is machine-friendly; strict format.
- YAML is human-friendly; used for configs.
- CSV is tabular and used for datasets.
- .env is for secrets and environment variables.
- Never commit real .env files.
- JSON mistakes: missing commas, wrong quotes.
- YAML requires indentation; no tabs allowed.
