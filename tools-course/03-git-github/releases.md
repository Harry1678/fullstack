# Releases and Tagging

### What is a Release?
A release marks a stable checkpoint in the project.  
It helps developers track progress, deploy versions, and organize work.

### Creating a Tag
To create a new version tag:

After creating a tag locally, you must push it to GitHub using:
git push origin <tag-name>

Once pushed, go to the GitHub repository → Releases → Draft a new release.
Select the tag, write release notes, and publish the release.
