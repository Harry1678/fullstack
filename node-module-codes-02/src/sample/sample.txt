A lot of backend work in Node.js involves working with files, data flowing through streams, and reacting to events.
This section helps you get comfortable with:

Reading and writing files (text, JSON, binary).
Understanding buffers and encodings.
Building pipelines with streams, handling backpressure.
Emitting and listening to custom events.
Using watchers to respond to filesystem changes.
Mastering these basics is crucial. Without them, you’ll either misuse libraries or get stuck when performance matters.
