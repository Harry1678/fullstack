# Concepts Learned

## 1. Good Notes vs. Bad Notes
- Good notes capture decisions, commands used, errors, solutions.
- Bad notes are diaries with unnecessary details.

## 2. Tight Work Loop
Editor → Terminal → Browser  
Stay in one project and avoid context switching.

## 3. Naming Conventions
Use lowercase with hyphens: project-setup/, learning-habits.md

## 4. Using LLMs Effectively
- Ask targeted questions.
- Provide context and errors.
- Use LLMs to clarify thinking, not replace it.
## Naming Conventions (Step 3)
- Use lowercase file/folder names.
- Use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces.
- Avoid special characters.
- Clean naming avoids issues with Git, Linux commands, scripts, and automation tools.
